# AirBnB Database System Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an AirBnB-like database system that manages property rentals, user interactions, bookings, payments, and reviews.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Management
- Users must be able to register with email, password, and personal information
- Support for multiple user roles (guest, host, admin)
- Users must have unique email addresses
- Password must be stored securely using hashing
- Users can update their profile information
- Phone numbers are optional but must be validated when provided

### 2. Property Management
- Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings
- Each property must have basic information (name, description, location, price)
- Properties must be linked to their respective hosts
- Property prices must be stored in decimal format
- Track creation and modification dates for all properties

### 3. Booking System
- Users can create bookings for available properties
- Bookings must include start date, end date, and total price
- Booking status must be tracked (pending, confirmed, canceled)
- Prevent double bookings for the same property on same dates
- Calculate total price based on number of nights and property price

### 4. Payment Processing
- Support multiple payment methods (credit_card, paypal, stripe)
- Record payment details for each booking
- Track payment dates and amounts
- Ensure payment amount matches booking total price
- One booking can have only one payment record

### 5. Review System
- Users can leave reviews for properties they've booked
- Reviews must include rating (1-5) and comment
- Users can't review properties they haven't booked
- Track when reviews are created
- One user can leave only one review per property per booking

### 6. Messaging System
- Users can send messages to other users
- Track sender and recipient for each message
- Store message content and timestamp
- Support communication between hosts and guests

## Technical Requirements

### Database Design
- Use UUID for primary keys
- Implement proper foreign key constraints
- Include appropriate indexes for performance
- Maintain referential integrity
- Use appropriate data types for each field

### Data Validation
- Validate email format
- Ensure rating values are between 1 and 5
- Validate date ranges for bookings
- Ensure price values are positive
- Validate phone number format when provided

### Performance Requirements
- Efficient query performance for common operations
- Proper indexing on frequently searched fields
- Optimize for read-heavy operations
- Support concurrent users and transactions

### Security Requirements
- Secure password storage using hashing
- Protection against SQL injection
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Audit trail for important operations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability
- Support for growing number of users and properties
- Efficient handling of large datasets
- Maintainable database structure

### Reliability

- Enhanced review and rating system
- Messaging system attachments
- Multi-language support

## Documentation Requirements

- API documentation for database operations
- Data dictionary
- Entity-Relationship diagrams
- Query optimization guidelines
